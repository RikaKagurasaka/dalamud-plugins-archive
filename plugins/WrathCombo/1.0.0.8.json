{"Author":"Team Wrath","Name":"Wrath Combo","Punchline":"Condenses combos and mutually exclusive abilities onto a single button - and then some.","Description":"Turns one action into many! Similar to how PvP actions work, we take an action and build a whole combo out of it. Sometimes it's as simple as a 1-2-3 combo, other times it's a full job rotation. Either way, you'll find something suited for your rotation needs.","Tags":[],"InternalName":"WrathCombo","RepoUrl":"https://github.com/PunishXIV/WrathCombo","DownloadCount":64244,"LastUpdate":1735727609486,"DownloadLinkInstall":"https://puni.sh/api/plugins/download/60/WrathCombo/versions/latest.zip","DownloadLinkUpdate":"https://puni.sh/api/plugins/download/60/WrathCombo/versions/latest.zip","AssemblyVersion":"1.0.0.8","ApplicableVersion":"any","DalamudApiLevel":"11","Changelog":"Please check the project's GitHub or Discord for a full changelog.","TestingAssemblyVersion":"1.0.0.9","DownloadLinkTesting":"https://puni.sh/api/plugins/download/60/WrathCombo/versions/testing.zip","TestingDalamudApiLevel":"11","IconUrl":"https://s3.puni.sh/media/plugin/60/icon-2bwhkn3zf1f.png"}
